  **~ 개발은 상상할 수 있는 꿈을 현실로 만드는 능력 ~**
  개발뿐만 아니라 협업 하는 과정과 기술도 매우 중요하다고 생각합니다!
  코드는 사람이 이해하기 쉽게 읽는 것! 이라는 마음가짐으로 클린 코드를 지향합니다.
  새로운 기술을 접하고 적용 하는 것을 좋아합니다!
  애자일 방식을 너무 좋아합니다!!

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
